Arduino IDE downloaded
Select Board -> Arduino Mega 2560
Downloaded Marlin/configuration.h from the Hypercube website
  They claim that they are for version 1.1-RC8 and above also 1.1.4. I set git
  repo back to 1.1.4 and now need to copy the configuration file with sensor.
Open Marlin/Configuration.h
