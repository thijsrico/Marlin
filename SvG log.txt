Arduino IDE downloaded
Select Board -> Arduino Mega 2560
Downloaded Marlin/configuration.h from Thingiverse->Hypercube
  They claim that they are for version 1.1-RC8 and above also 1.1.4. I set git
  repo back to 1.1.4 and copied the configuration file with sensor.
Open Marlin/Configuration.h
  Note: MOTHERBOARD is 1.4 EFB, extruder fan bed, these are the pins D8-D10
  Check temperature sensors. I think the TEMP_SENSOR_0 is OK. Also, I checked TEMP_SENSOR_BED with the dx.com specification: 3950.
  maybe HEATER_0_MAXTEMP ... HEATER_4_MAXTEMP and BED_MAXTEMP should be lowered according to http://solidutopia.com/marlin-firmware-user-guide-basic/
  Disabled PIDTEMPBED (enabled by Thingiverse) since bed is not as precise
  PIDTEMP for the hotend is on by default, let's keep it that way.
  todo check ENDSTOPPULLUPS
  todo check if need invert X_MIN_ENDSTOP_INVERTING etc.
  todo check if ENDSTOP_INTERRUPTS_FEATURE really works
  todo DEFAULT_AXIS_STEPS_PER_UNIT was decreased, is it ok?
  todo DEFAULT_MAX_ACCELERATION was decreased, is it ok?
  todo the following were changed
    DEFAULT_ACCELERATION 3000 -> 1500
    DEFAULT_RETRACT_ACCELERATION 3000 -> 10000 -svg> 3000
    DEFAULT_TRAVEL_ACCELERATION 3000 -> 2000
  todo check ok
    DEFAULT_XJERK 20 -> 10
    DEFAULT_YJERK 20 -> 10
  todo FIX_MOUNTED_PROBE was enabled, what does it do?
  todo check ok
    X_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER
    Y_PROBE_OFFSET_FROM_EXTRUDER
  todo probe double touch was enabled
  todo Z_CLEARANCE_DEPLOY_PROBE was set to 0 from 10, why???
  todo check INVERT_Y_DIR
  todo MIN_SOFTWARE_ENDSTOPS was commented, I uncommented it again
  checked with Thijs
    // Preheat Constants
    #define PREHEAT_1_TEMP_HOTEND 180
    #define PREHEAT_1_TEMP_BED     60
    #define PREHEAT_1_FAN_SPEED     0 // Value from 0 to 255

    #define PREHEAT_2_TEMP_HOTEND 235
    #define PREHEAT_2_TEMP_BED     60
    #define PREHEAT_2_FAN_SPEED     0 // Value from 0 to 255
  SDSUPPORT disabled because it is not there
  Reprap PID smart controller disabled because it is not there
Open Marlin.ino
  Verify, takes few mins.

  Plug in temperature sensors
  Plug in USB cable
  Open Pronterface
	COM7 (or whatever) and baud 250000
  Test the temperature sensors
	Bed label was correct but connection was poor, redone
  Plug in endstops x3
	1mm over bij endstop
  m119 to test the endstops
  Insert x axis
  Insert power
  g91 to move only relatively
  g1 x10 to move diagonally
    ??? does pronterface know that we are going diagonally
  g1 e10 testing the extruder
	m302 give cold extrusion status
	m302 p1 disable cold extrusion checking
	m302 p0 enable cold extrusion checking
  m106 to enable part cooling fan
  m107 to disable the part cooling fan
  m140 set bed target temperature
